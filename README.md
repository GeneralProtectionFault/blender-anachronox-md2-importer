# Anachronox MD2 import add-on for Blender 3.x

## Based on:
https://github.com/lennart-g/blender-md2-importer

## Overview
In Blender, go to Edit => Preferences, then select Add-ons.  Click "Install" and select the .py file.  This will install the plugin.
To use, go to File => Import, then select Anachronox Model Import (.md2), then select the model file.


## TBD:
Multiple skins per model (the texture coordinates do load but are not distributed between multiple materials automatically).
